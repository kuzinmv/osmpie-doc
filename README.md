## OSMPIE - perfect intersection editor 

Road mapping is not for the faint-hearted. It requires attention to detail and skill in working with tags, including unofficial or experimental ones.

**OSMPIE helps** by:
- visually validating tags — if something’s wrong, it’s visible immediately;  
- allowing you to share a link to edits for review before uploading to OSM;  
- making it easy to export data to GIS formats (GeoJSON, etc.).  

The result — fewer guesses and long chat threads, more accurate data on the map.  
And of course, a bit of joy in the process: it’s nice when an intersection in OSM looks like an intersection, not just a “colorful X made of two lines.”
