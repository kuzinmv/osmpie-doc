## OSMPIE - OSM Perfect Intersection's Editor

At higher zoom levels, the human eye finds significantly greater visual satisfaction in observing representations that authentically resemble actual roadways rather than mere orange and yellow stripes. Contemporary maps frequently display intricate nearby objects such as [trees](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:natural%3Dtree), [bicycle parking facilities](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dbicycle_parking), [dropped kerbs](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:kerb) at crossings, [manholes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:manhole), and [benches](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dbench). Paradoxically, complex infrastructural elements such as roads and intersections are represented merely as one or two colored lines. This fundamental disparity in representation quality demands immediate rectification.

OSMPIE comprises two principal components that work in synergy to address this challenge:

1. **Road Rendering Engine**: This sophisticated system transforms OSM road objects (attributed ways, nodes, and relations) into a comprehensive new set of geographic objects that maintain both topological and geometrical relationships with their original OSM counterparts.

2. **Specialized Editor/Viewer**: A purpose-built interface designed for rapid and intuitive mapping of roads and intersections within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem.

## Prerequisites and Technical Challenges

Drawing from extensive experience in constructing and operating road network models, our development team recognized that implementing graph expansion functionality and generating new connections that reflect consistent network topology relative to both source data and ground truth represents one of the most critical technical challenges.

> *Topology precedes geometry in all implementations.*

The primary objective involved constructing a comprehensive road network graph wherein each traffic lane possesses its own centerline representation. The secondary challenge required addressing connectivity issues at intersections. Only upon successful resolution of these topological foundations could geometric transformations and constructions be effectively implemented.

## Motivation and Design Philosophy

Road mapping, particularly for complex intersections, presents significant challenges that demand highly developed spatial visualization skills from cartographers. While existing tools provide valuable visualization assistance, our objective transcends current capabilities: achieving the perfect intersection model and its accurate digital representation.

The disparity between detailed representation of minor objects and oversimplified road infrastructure visualization motivated the development of OSMPIE as a comprehensive solution for professional-grade road mapping.

## Intersection Definition and Functional Model

### What Constitutes an "Intersection"?

From a functional modeling perspective, an intersection must possess and interconnect the following essential object set:

- **Stop Line or Entry Point**: The precise location where vehicles enter the intersection (stopline - blue point - corresponding to traffic sign 5.15)
- **Approach**: A coordinated group of stop lines from a single directional approach
- **Exit Point**: The designated location where vehicles leave the intersection (exitpoint - red point)
- **Route**: The defined path connecting entry to exit points (route - purple line)
- **Conflict Points**: Critical locations where multiple routes intersect, creating potential vehicle conflicts (conflict point - black point)

### Fundamental Intersection Characteristics

1. **Dual Nature**: Intersections possess both areal and graph-based properties, embodying both [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry) and [topological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology) characteristics.

2. **Cluster Composition**: An intersection represents a cluster of multiple individual crossing points rather than a singular entity.

3. **Radius-Based Characterization**: Each crossing can be characterized by two critical radii that bridge the graph-based and areal nature of intersections:
   - **Intersection Radius**: Defines the area of the conflict zone
   - **Clustering Radius**: Determines the area of influence one intersection exerts on others

4. **Movement-Only Zone**: Intersections represent areas where traffic regulations prohibit vehicle stopping, permitting only continuous movement through designated lanes and directions.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Required Actions

Users should utilize any standard editor to input OSM tags for roads while exercising particular caution with relation objects. The official OSM tags and proposals provide 90-95% of the functionality required for comprehensive road mapping and rendering capabilities.

Through OSMPIE development, we have identified and defined a minimal set of simple tags along with several extensions to existing schemas that achieve 100% functionality coverage.

### Required Tags

**Official OSM Tags:**
```
highway
crossing
lanes:*
turn:lanes
width
width:lanes
psv:lanes
placement
parking:{side}:*
cycleway:{side}
bus_bay
tram
... and additional standard tags
```

**New Extended Tags:**
```
connect:lanes
junction:shape
junction:radius
junction:cluster:radius
crossing:corner
```

### Visual Validation Capability

The OSMPIE renderer functions as a sophisticated visual validator. When the rendered output does not meet aesthetic expectations, appears imperfect, or fails to correspond accurately to satellite imagery, this typically indicates the need for additional tags or correction of existing attributes.

## User Benefits and Practical Advantages

### Enhanced Workflow Capabilities

- **WYSIWYG Editing**: Road and intersection tag input and markup becomes significantly more accurate, precise, and user-friendly with [What You See Is What You Get](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) capabilities
- **Multi-Editor Compatibility**: Support for loading [*.osc](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmChange) files created in alternative editors
- **Export Functionality**: Save proposed modifications and open them in JOSM or other editors for continued refinement
- **Collaborative Review**: Share links with other users for modification discussion before implementation, particularly valuable for complex or ambiguous cases
- **Visual Change Tracking**: Comprehensive visual representation of all map modifications
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Export or save all OSMPIE-generated objects in GeoJSON format, with direct integration to `geojson.io` for conversion to Shapefile, CSV, KML, and other formats
- **Quality Enhancement**: Contribute to OSM improvement with reduced effort and increased precision

### Input Data Specifications

**Source Data**: Overpass API queries returning comprehensive `highway=*` objects and related road infrastructure elements. All objects appear in the editor's left panel and remain available for modification (tags and geometry).

## Conclusion and Future Development

While the OSMPIE renderer maintains high accuracy standards, it may occasionally produce minor errors. However, its primary function involves precisely reflecting user specifications through OSM object tagging schemas, enhanced with aesthetic improvements including corner rounding and automatic marking generation.

### Current Version Limitations

The initial public release of OSMPIE features non-customizable road marking generation that produces maximum coverage but may not reflect specific local marking conventions, such as parking spaces or pedestrian crossings. The marking renderer operates to indicate object existence, lane presence, and dimensional characteristics. We prioritize rapid resolution of these limitations in immediate future updates.

### Technical Philosophy

OSMPIE represents a paradigm shift toward professional-grade intersection modeling within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, bridging the gap between simplified line representations and the complex reality of modern road infrastructure. Through systematic application of enhanced tagging schemas and sophisticated rendering algorithms, OSMPIE enables cartographers to create precise, visually compelling representations that serve both aesthetic and functional requirements.
